# bird_project
raw data and scripts (data import, manipulation, models, results and visualizations). data supplied by constance woodman.

the pipe operator %>% is used heavily here as it allows for simpler and more legible code. it is part of the magrittr package which is downloaded by default when loading the tidyverse package used in these scripts. more can be read here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html

box plots are included in the visualizations script for experimental purposes. viewing variable distributions by hour may be useful but will not always provide immediately obvious insights.
