raw data and scripts (data import, manipulation, models, results and visualizations). data supplied by constance woodman.


## additional notes

more in-depth information about the forecast package in r can be found here: https://otexts.com/fpp2/

the pipe operator %>% is used heavily in these scripts as it allows for simpler and more legible code. it is part of the magrittr package which is downloaded by default when loading the tidyverse package used in these scripts. more about the pipe operator, and the tidyverse package in general, can be found here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html

box plots are included in the visualizations script for experimental purposes. viewing variable distributions by hour may be useful but will not always provide immediately obvious insights.
